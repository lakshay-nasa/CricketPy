***** "Don't Know How to Play" ---->
                     Don't worry Its just like a real cricket  *****

1. First you have to choose *Head* OR *Tail* , if you win you will get 'Batting'. If you loose you will get bowling.
2. Batting means your Score will be counted whereas in bowling opponent score will be counted.
3. Player which has more score will be winner.
